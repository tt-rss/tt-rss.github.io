Tiny Tiny RSS provides four options for how articles appear within a
selected feed: `Default`, `Newest`, `Oldest`, `Title`.

{: .note }
> Special feeds (e.g. *Starred-articles*) have unique sorting when *Default* is selected, otherwise they behave as described below.

- *Descending score* means **higher numbers** are shown before lower numbers.
- *Descending date/time* means **more recent** is shown before less recent.
- *Ascending date/time* means **less recent** is shown before more recent.
