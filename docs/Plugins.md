Tiny Tiny RSS supports many kinds of plugins: social plugins which share
articles to various sites, article filter plugins which mangle feed-provided
data on import (for example, inlining images or extracting full article-text
using Readability), hotkey plugins which alter the way keyboard shortcuts work,
etc.

There are two kinds of plugins: user and system. User plugins are enabled in
`Preferences` &rarr; `Plugins`. System plugins require adding them to a [global
configuration](Global-Config) directive <code>PLUGINS</code> which is a
comma-separated list of enabled system plugins, i.e.

```js
putenv('TTRSS_PLUGINS=auth_internal,-other_plugin');
```

System plugins are always enabled for all users. If multiple search plugins are loaded, only the first one is used

If you are interested in making plugins, see [Making-Plugins](Making-Plugins),

### Installing plugins

> [!NOTE]
> First party plugins can be added via built-in plugin installer in `Preferences` &rarr; `Plugins`.

Copy plugin folder to ```tt-rss/plugins.local``` then activate it in the settings panel.
Plugin folder name should correspond to plugin class name defined in ``(plugin)/init.php``,
i.e. ``Af_ExamplePlugin`` should be copied to ``plugins.local/af_exampleplugin``.
