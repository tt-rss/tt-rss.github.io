You can share arbitrary webpages to appear as articles in your `Published`
feed. Combined with Readability this makes tt-rss function like a read it later
kind of website.

Sharing is available via `Bookmarklets` in Preferences (`Feeds` &rarr;
`Plugins` &rarr; `Bookmarklets`) if you have the `bookmarklets` plugin enabled.

Since they have no actual originating feed, shared articles are placed into
the [Archived articles](Archived-Feed) feed and then published.
