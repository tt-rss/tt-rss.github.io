The main (and-recommended) way to run tt-rss is under Docker.

Docker images for <https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss> are being built (for `linux/amd64` and-`linux/arm64`) and published
([via GitHub-Actions](https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss/actions/workflows/publish.yml)) to:
* Docker Hub (as-[supahgreg/tt-rss](https://hub.docker.com/r/supahgreg/tt-rss/) and [supahgreg/tt-rss-web-nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/supahgreg/tt-rss-web-nginx/)).
* GitHub Container Registry (as-[ghcr.io/tt-rss/tt-rss](https://github.com/orgs/tt-rss/packages/container/package/tt-rss)
  and [ghcr.io/tt-rss/tt-rss-web-nginx](https://github.com/orgs/tt-rss/packages/container/package/tt-rss-web-nginx)).

> [!WARNING]
> Podman is not Docker. Please don't report issues related to running tt-rss when using Podman or Podman Compose.

This setup uses PostgreSQL and runs tt-rss using several containers as outlined below.
Consider using an external [Patroni cluster](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of a single `db` container in "production" deployments.

## TL;DR

Place both `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` together in a directory, edit `.env` as you see fit, run `docker compose up -d`.

### .env

```ini
# Put any local modifications here.

# Run FPM under this UID/GID.
# OWNER_UID=1000
# OWNER_GID=1000

# FPM settings.
#PHP_WORKER_MAX_CHILDREN=5
#PHP_WORKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=256M

# ADMIN_USER_* settings are applied on every startup.

# Set admin user password to this value. If not set, random password
# will be generated on startup, look for it in the 'app' container logs.
#ADMIN_USER_PASS=

# Sets admin user access level to this value. Valid values:
# -2 - forbidden to login
# -1 - readonly
#  0 - default user
# 10 - admin
#ADMIN_USER_ACCESS_LEVEL=

# Auto create another user (in addition to built-in-admin) unless it already exists.
#AUTO_CREATE_USER=
#AUTO_CREATE_USER_PASS=
#AUTO_CREATE_USER_ACCESS_LEVEL=0

# Default database credentials.
TTRSS_DB_USER=postgres
TTRSS_DB_NAME=postgres
TTRSS_DB_PASS=password

# You can customize other config.php defines by setting overrides here.
# See tt-rss/.docker/app/Dockerfile for a complete list.

# You probably shouldn't disable auth_internal unless you know what you're doing.
# TTRSS_PLUGINS=auth_internal,auth_remote
# TTRSS_SINGLE_USER_MODE=true
# TTRSS_SESSION_COOKIE_LIFETIME=2592000
# TTRSS_FORCE_ARTICLE_PURGE=30
# ...

# Bind exposed port to 127.0.0.1 to run behind reverse proxy on the same host.
# If you plan to expose the container, remove "127.0.0.1:".
HTTP_PORT=127.0.0.1:8280
#HTTP_PORT=8280
```

### docker-compose.yml

>[!WARNING]
> See [this FAQ entry](#i-got-the-updated-docker-compose-file-above-and-now-my-database-keeps-restarting)
> if you're upgrading between PostgreSQL major versions (e.g. 15 to-17).

> [!WARNING]
> Regarding PostgreSQL 18:
> * The `backups` container image currently includes `postgresql17-client`, meaning it won't be able to back up your DB if you use PostgreSQL 18.
    Consider using an alternative backup solution if you're using PostgreSQL 18.
> * The PostgreSQL 18 Docker image changed the volume from `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to `/var/lib/postgresql`.
>   The example below includes a commented-out volume mapping that demonstrates this.
>   * See <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres> and <https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/pull/1259> for more info.

## FAQ

### Your Docker images won't run on X

If you're using an OS or architecture that isn't currently supported you'll likely need to
build your own Docker images by using an override and running `docker compose build`.

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  app:
    image: supahgreg/tt-rss:latest
    # or
    # image: ghcr.io/tt-rss/tt-rss:latest
    build:
      dockerfile: .docker/app/Dockerfile
      context: https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss.git
      args:
        BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR: 1

  web-nginx:
    image: supahgreg/tt-rss-web-nginx:latest
    # or
    # image: ghcr.io/tt-rss/tt-rss-web-nginx:latest
    build:
      dockerfile: .docker/web-nginx/Dockerfile
      context: https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss.git
```

`BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR` build argument is needed to display tt-rss version info properly.
If that doesn't work for you (no-BuildKit?) you'll have to resort to terrible hacks.

> [!WARNING]
> Self-built images are not necessarily supported (i.e. best effort and/or community-support).

### I got the updated Docker Compose file above and now my database keeps restarting

We'll use the following error message as an example of what you might see in the logs:

`Error message: The data directory was initialized by PostgreSQL version 12, which is not compatible with this version 15.4.`

Official PostgreSQL containers have no support for migrating data between major versions.
Using the aforementioned example, you could do one of the following:

1. Replace `postgres:15-alpine` with `postgres:12-alpine` in `docker-compose.yml` (or use `docker-compose.override.yml`, see-below) and keep using PG 12
2. Use [this DB container](https://github.com/pgautoupgrade/docker-pgautoupgrade) which would automatically upgrade the database
3. Migrate the data manually using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` (somewhat complicated if you haven't done it-before)

### I'm using docker-compose.override.yml and now I'm getting schema update (and-other) strange issues

Alternatively, you've changed something related to `/var/www/html/tt-rss` in `docker-compose.yml`.

Your Docker setup is messed up for some reason, so tt-rss can't update itself to the persistent storage location on startup (this is just an example of one issue, there could be many-others).

Consider undoing any recent changes, looking up error messages, etc.

### How do I make it run without /tt-rss/ in the URL, i.e. at website root?

Set the following variables in `.env`:

```ini
APP_WEB_ROOT=/var/www/html/tt-rss
APP_BASE=
```

Don't forget to remove `/tt-rss/` from `TTRSS_SELF_URL_PATH`.

### How do I apply configuration options?

There are two sets of options you can change through the environment - options specific to tt-rss (those are prefixed with-`TTRSS_`) and options affecting container behavior.

#### Options specific to tt-rss

For example, to set tt-rss global option `SELF_URL_PATH`, add the following to `.env`:

```ini
TTRSS_SELF_URL_PATH=http://example.com/tt-rss
```

Don't use quotes around values. Note the prefix (`TTRSS_`) before the value.

Look at [Global-Config](Global-Config.md) for more information.

#### Container options

Some options, but not all, are mentioned in `.env-dist`. You can see all available options in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss/blob/main/.docker/app/Dockerfile).

### How do I customize the YML without committing my changes to git?

You can use [docker-compose.override.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/). For example, customize `db` to use a different `postgres` image:

```yml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
```

### I'm trying to run CLI tt-rss scripts inside the container and they complain about root

In your Docker Compose directory, run something like one of the examples below.
Check <https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss/blob/main/.docker/app/Dockerfile> for the latest image's PHP version.

```sh
docker compose exec --user app app php84 /var/www/html/tt-rss/update.php --help

#                           ^   ^
#                           |   |
#                           |   +- service (container) name
#                           +----- run as user
```

or

```sh
docker compose exec app sudo -Eu app php84 /var/www/html/tt-rss/update.php --help
```

or

```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> sudo -Eu app php84 /var/www/html/tt-rss/update.php --help
```

Note: `sudo -E` is needed to keep environment variables.

### How do I add plugins and themes?

> [!NOTE]
> First party plugins can be added using plugin installer in `Preferences` &rarr; `Plugins`.

By default, tt-rss code is stored on a persistent Docker volume (`app`). You can find
its location like this:

```sh
docker volume inspect ttrss-docker_app | grep Mountpoint
```

Alternatively, you can mount any host directory as ``/var/www/html`` by updating ``docker-compose.yml``, i.e.:

```yml
volumes:
      - app:/var/www/html
```

Replace with:

```yml
volumes:
      - /opt/tt-rss:/var/www/html
```

Copy and/or git clone any third party plugins into ``plugins.local`` as usual.

### I'm running into 502 errors and/or other connectivity issues

First, check that all containers are running:

```text
$ docker compose ps
                   Name                                 Command               State           Ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ttrss-docker-demo_app_1_f49351cb24ed         /bin/sh -c /startup.sh           Up      9000/tcp
ttrss-docker-demo_backups_1_8d2aa404e31a     /dcron.sh -f                     Up      9000/tcp
ttrss-docker-demo_db_1_fc1a842fe245          docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
ttrss-docker-demo_updater_1_b7fcc8f20419     /updater.sh                      Up      9000/tcp
ttrss-docker-demo_web-nginx_1_fcef07eb5c55   /docker-entrypoint.sh ngin ...   Up      127.0.0.1:8280->80/tcp
```

Then, ensure that frontend (`web-nginx` or-`web`) container is up and can contact FPM (`app`) container:

```text
$ docker compose exec web-nginx ping app
PING app (172.18.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.144 ms
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.128 ms
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.206 ms
^C
--- app ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.128/0.159/0.206 ms
```

Containers communicate via DNS names assigned by Docker based on service names defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This means that services (specifically,-`app`) and Docker DNS service should be functional.

Similar issues may be also caused by Docker `iptables` functionality either being disabled or conflicting with `nftables`.

### I want to rename `app` (FPM) container

You can but you'll need to pass `APP_UPSTREAM` environment variable to the `web-nginx` container with its new name.

### How do I put this container behind a reverse proxy?

- Don't forget to pass `X-Forwarded-Proto` to the container if you're using HTTPS, otherwise tt-rss would generate plain HTTP URLs.
- Upstream address and port are set using `HTTP_PORT` in `.env`:

```ini
HTTP_PORT=127.0.0.1:8280
```

#### nginx example

```nginx
location /tt-rss/ {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8280/tt-rss/;
    break;
}
```

If you run into problems with global PHP-to-FPM handler taking priority over proxied location, define the tt-rss location like this so it takes higher priority:

```nginx
location ^~ /tt-rss/ {
   ....
}
```

If you want to pass an entire nginx virtual host to tt-rss:

```nginx
server {
   server_name rss.example.com;

   ...

   location / {
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8280/;
      break;
   }
}
```

Note that `proxy_pass` in this example points to container website root.

#### Apache example

```apache
<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    <Location /tt-rss>
      ProxyPreserveHost On
      ProxyPass        http://localhost:8280/tt-rss
      ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8280/tt-rss
      RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
    </Location>
  </IfModule>
```

### I have internal web services tt-rss is complaining about (URL is invalid, loopback address, disallowed-ports)

Put your local services on the same Docker network with tt-rss, then access them by service (=-host) names, i.e. `http://rss-bridge/`.

```yml
services:
   rss-bridge:
....
networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: ttrss-docker_default
```

If your service uses a non-standard (i.e. not 80 or-443) port, make an internal reverse proxy sidecar container for it.

### Backup and restore

If you have `backups` container enabled, stock configuration makes automatic backups (database, local plugins,-etc.) once a week to a separate storage volume.

Note that this container is included as a safety net for people who wouldn't bother with backups otherwise.
If you value your data, you should invest your time into setting up something like [WAL-G](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g) instead.

#### Manually taking a backup

To run [`.docker/app/backup.sh`](https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss/blob/main/.docker/app/backup.sh) (the backup script that executes-weekly):

`docker compose exec backups /etc/periodic/weekly/backup`

Alternatively, if you want to initiate backups from the host (or if you're using PostgreSQL 18+, currently incompatible with the `backup`-container) you can do something like this:

```sh
source .env
docker compose exec \
  -e PGPASSWORD="$TTRSS_DB_PASS" \
  db \
  /bin/bash \
  -c "export PGPASSWORD=$TTRSS_DB_PASS \
    && pg_dump -U $TTRSS_DB_USER $TTRSS_DB_NAME" \
  | gzip -9 > backup.sql.gz
```

#### Restoring backups

The process to restore the database from a `backups` container backup might look like this:

1. Enter `backups` container shell: `docker compose exec backups /bin/sh`
2. Inside the container, locate and choose the backup file: `ls -t /backups/*.sql.gz`
3. Clear database (**THIS WOULD DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE-DB**): `psql -h db -U $TTRSS_DB_USER $TTRSS_DB_NAME -e -c "drop schema public cascade; create schema public"`
3. Restore the backup: `zcat /backups/ttrss-backup-yyyymmdd.sql.gz | psql -h db -U $TTRSS_DB_USER $TTRSS_DB_NAME`

### How do I use custom certificates?

You need to mount custom certificates into the *app* and *updater* containers like this:

```yml
volumes:
    ....
    ./ca1.crt:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca1.crt:ro
    ./ca2.crt:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca2.crt:ro
    ....
```

Don't forget to restart the containers.

### How do I run these images on Kubernetes?

You'll need to set several mandatory environment values to the container running the `web-nginx` image:

1. `APP_UPSTREAM` should point to the fully-qualified DNS service name provided by the app (FPM) container/pod
2. `RESOLVER` should be set to `kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local`

### Where's the Helm chart?

You'll have to make your own.

### I'm using Podman, and

We neither test against nor support Podman.
