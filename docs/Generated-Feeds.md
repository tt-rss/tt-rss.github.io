You can generate a feed (in Atom or JSON-format) for almost anything displayed
in headlines buffer (e.g. actual feeds, Labels, Categories,-etc.) by clicking
this icon:

![Generated feed icon](../images/gen_feed_icon.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Subscribing to your own feed of search results is going to produce
> duplicate articles on each and every feed update.

## Data protection

Feed URLs are protected using random unique keys which are specific to each
generated feed. Key can be regenerated at any time, invalidating previous URL.

![Generated feed dialog](../images/gen_feed_dialog.png)

You can clear all generated feeds in Preferences (`Feeds` &rarr; `Published-&
shared articles`).

## Anatomy of a generated feed URL

```text
http://example.com/tt-rss/public.php?op=rss&id=61&is_cat=1&view-mode=adaptive&key=...
```

- ``id`` (integer) - requested feed ID
- ``is_cat`` (boolean) - whether the feed is a category
- ``view-mode`` (string) - see below
- ``key`` (string) - automatically generated access key, specific to feed id

### Optional parameters

- ``login``, ``pass`` - see above
- ``format`` - since version:1.6.0 specifies output format, possible values: ``atom``, ``json``
- ``limit`` - amount of articles to output, default: 30
- ``offset`` - start output while skipping this amount of articles, default: 0
- ``order`` - override default headlines order
- ``ts`` - output articles newer than timestamp in [strtotime](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)
    accepted format (since-version:1.12) i.e. stuff like <code>ts=1%20month%20ago</code>

### Special feed IDs

- ``-1`` - Starred articles
- ``-2`` - Published articles
- ``-3`` - Fresh articles
- ``-4`` - All articles
- ``0`` - Archived articles

Feed ID values less than `-10` are considered Labels.

### Special category IDs (is\_cat=1)

- ``0`` - Uncategorized
- ``-1`` - Special category (includes Starred, Published,-etc.)
- ``-2`` - Labels category (includes your-labels)

### View mode values

Note: It's probably not a very good idea to use Adaptive view mode for
generated feeds.

- <code>adaptive</code> - shows unread articles only when they are
    unread articles, shows everything otherwise
- <code>marked</code> (this means-starred), <code>has\_note</code>,
    <code>published</code>, <code>unread</code>,
    <code>unread\_first</code> - should be self explanatory

Actual output may differ between modes for several special feeds for
usability reasons, e.g. recently read feed ignores <code>unread</code>
specifier because unread articles are never part of the feed).

### Order values

- ``default`` - depends on the feed: either import batch date or (for published and starred-feeds) ``last_published`` and ``last_marked``
- ``title`` - sort by title
- ``date_reverse`` - reverse sort by batch date
- ``feed_dates`` - sort by feed-provided article dates
